I studied B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from NMIT, Bangalore. I currently have 1 year of work experience.
I have learnt some weapons to use in the industry, including:

- JavaScript (React js, node js, next js)
- .net
- Java
- DBMS

And I look further to do more, grow more and achieve more.
