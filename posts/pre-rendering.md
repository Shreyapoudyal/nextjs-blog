Born in a beautiful Himalayan country Nepal, enjoying my childhood at the heart of it, both as a talented girl and a forward student, learning from my parents' struggles, I grew up with strong leadership and communication skills, achieving positions like student coordinator of my engineering college, Head of 'Master of Ceremonies' team, to organizing national level hackathons while winning in others' ;)  

As an individual, I am an empathetic and understanding, a hardworking ambivert with good analytical skills too.

Lastly, I am a nature lover who wants to enjoy life staying like a child.
